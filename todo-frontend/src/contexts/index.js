export {TodoContext, TodoProvider, useTodo} from "./TodoContext"

// The line you provided is an export statement that re-exports the TodoContext, TodoProvider, and useTodo from the TodoContext file.

// This line of code essentially "aggregates" all of the exports from the TodoContext.js file into one place, which allows you to import all three from index.js instead of importing each item separately from the TodoContext.js file.
